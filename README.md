# Quark---Privacy-Policy

Quark – Privacy Policy

Last updated: [October 04, 2025]

Quark (“the App”) helps you build habits by revealing a picture as you stay consistent. We designed Quark to be privacy-first: your habit data lives on your device and is never sent to our servers, because we don’t run any.

If you have questions, contact us at kenanbaltaci@gmail.com.

1) Summary (the short version)

No account, no cloud, no ads, no trackers.

Data stays on your device. Habit names, schedules, check-ins, and images are stored locally.

Photos are yours. If you choose a photo from your library, we only read it locally to show and generate the reveal—nothing is uploaded.

Payments are handled by Apple. We never see your full payment information.

Notifications are optional and happen locally on device.

Widgets read a small on-device snapshot to render your habit progress on the Home Screen.

2) Data We Collect & Process

We don’t collect personal data on our servers. The App processes the following on your device:

Habit Data: habit names, descriptions, schedules, check-ins, progress, and cycle completion counts.

Images: the picture you select from the built-in gallery or your photo library (if you grant Photos access). Images are used only to render the reveal and widget thumbnail locally.

Preferences: theme/accent color, appearance (light/dark/system), and other in-app settings.

Purchase State: a local “Pro” entitlement flag based on Apple’s purchase/receipt status and product identifiers (e.g., monthly/yearly/lifetime).

Widget Snapshot Files: a compact, local snapshot (and optional thumbnail) stored in the App Group container so the widget can display your habit.

We do not collect precise location, contacts, health data, or any analytics/behavioral profiles.

3) How We Use Data

All processing happens to provide the App’s features:

Show your habit list, reveals, progress bars, and calendars.

Schedule local notifications you opt into.

Render Home Screen widgets using the local snapshot/thumbnail.

Determine Pro access (intro trial/entitlements) from Apple’s receipt.

We do not sell data, and we do not use third-party advertising or tracking SDKs.

4) Data Sharing

Apple (StoreKit): Purchases, trials, and subscription management are handled by Apple. We receive product metadata and receipt status to unlock Pro features; we do not receive your full payment details.

Support Communication: If you contact us by email or form, we’ll use the information you provide only to reply and troubleshoot.

We do not share your data with advertisers or data brokers.

5) Permissions

Photos (optional): Used only if you choose “Use Your Own Image (Pro).” The App reads selected images to display/reveal them locally. Nothing is uploaded.

Notifications (optional): Used to remind you to check in. You can change this anytime in Settings ▸ Notifications.

Widgets: Requires granting widget access on your device. Widgets read only the on-device snapshot in the App Group container.

You can revoke permissions at any time in iOS Settings.

6) Data Storage, Security & Retention

Storage location: All habit data, preferences, and widget snapshots are stored on your device (including the shared App Group container for the widget).

Security: iOS provides data protection and sandboxing. We follow platform best practices and minimize stored data.

Retention: Data remains until you delete it in the app or uninstall the app. Purchase receipts are managed by Apple.

7) Your Choices & Controls

Export/Backup: (If you offer export) You may export your data from the app to a file you control.

Delete: Delete habits individually or remove the app to delete all local data on the device.

Opt-out of notifications: Turn off in the app or Settings ▸ Notifications.

Photos permission: Revoke in Settings ▸ Privacy ▸ Photos.

Widgets: Remove the widget at any time; you can also clear pinned content within the app.

8) Children’s Privacy

Quark is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child provided us information via support, contact [Email] and we will delete it.

9) International Users

We do not operate servers; your data stays on your device. Purchases are processed by Apple in accordance with Apple’s terms and your App Store region.

10) Changes to This Policy

If we make material changes, we’ll update the date at the top and, when appropriate, notify you in-app. Continued use of Quark after changes means you accept the updated policy.
